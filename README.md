# algae
A sandbox for a project started nearly 20 years ago.

## Current
My son introduced me to `p5.js` and it has inspired me to have another go
at the problem space.  So initially, I want to replicate what I wrote in
Delphi.

## Installation
Download https://github.com/processing/p5.js/releases/download/0.6.1/p5.zip
or a later one if that is your preference.

## History
First written in Delphi using Conway's Game of Life as inspiration.
The implementation made pretty pictures that (initially) looked like algae.

The delphic code has been checked in for reference, although the forms and
resources have not.  Probably not an issue as it will never be compiled.
The latest date stamp on the files was 2001/04/07.

The version control used was numbered copies of folders. The earliest
timestamp is 1999/12/30, so this must have been a Christmas Holidays
project.  I probably got a Borland Delphi compiler for Christmas...
