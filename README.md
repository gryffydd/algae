# algae
A sandbox for a project started over 20 years ago

## Current
My son introduced me to `p5.js` and it has inspired me to have another go
at the problem space.  So initially, I want to replicate what I wrote in
Delphi.

## History
First written in Delphi using Conway's Game of Life as inspiration.
The implementation made pretty pictures that (initially) looked like algae.
